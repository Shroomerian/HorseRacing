# HorseRacing

This repository is C++ solution to the problem seen in https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-9-find-the-fastest-3-horses/
or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-xqRDwpilM&lc=Ugxxq4yKVM3moyoykGJ4AaABAg.9qM9Mb5CJbU9riATM48_4N

It includes a class that doesn't allow you to see the values of the horses, and instead you have to use the Racing
functions in the class to order the numbers and find numbers 1, 2 and 3.

This project uses CMake, you can build and run it this way if you download the source:

```
git clone https://github.com/Shroomerian/HorseRacing.git
cd HorseRacing/build && cmake ..
make
./src/HorseRacing
```
